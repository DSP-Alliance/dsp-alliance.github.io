        <h1>FIL+: 1x Multiplier</h1>
        <p>Below we provide a detailed analysis of the 1x multiplier as the optimal choice in <a href=https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/774>FIP Discussion #774</a>, Motivation for a Scheduled Reduction in the Quality Multiplier of Fil+ Deals and Example Timelines. Here, we outline its significant advantages for network macroeconomics, security, and the comprehensive health of the system.
        </p>

        <h2>Simplicity and Clarity</h2>
        <p>The choice of 1x multipliers in the protocol economic system offers simplicity and clarity. The concept of multipliers introduces a level of complexity that can be avoided with the use of a 1x multiplier. The 1x multiplier is straightforward, easy to understand, and eliminates the need for complex calculations or considerations. It provides a clear and consistent framework for all participants in the system, reducing the potential for confusion or misinterpretation. The simplicity of the 1x multiplier also makes it easier to implement and manage, reducing the risk of errors or issues that could disrupt the system. This simplicity and clarity are essential for the smooth operation of the protocol economic system and for ensuring that all participants understand and can effectively engage with the system.</p>

        <h2>Fairness and Equality</h2>
        <p>The use of a 1x multiplier also promotes fairness and equality. With a 1x multiplier, all sectors are treated equally, with no sector gaining an unfair advantage over others. This ensures that all sectors have an equal opportunity to participate and succeed in the system. In contrast, allowing sectors to choose their own multipliers could lead to bias and inequality, with some sectors gaining an unfair competitive advantage over others. For example, sectors that take the lead in adopting a higher multiplier could gain an unfair advantage in the block reward distribution. This could create a system that favors certain sectors over others, undermining the principle of fairness and equality that is fundamental to the protocol economic system. By sticking with a 1x multiplier, we can ensure that all sectors are treated equally and fairly, promoting a balanced and equitable system.</p>

        <h2>Long-Term Sustainability</h2>
        <p>TThe 1x multiplier is a key component in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol economic system. It provides a stable and predictable framework for all participants, allowing them to make informed decisions and plan for the future. This stability is crucial for the long-term health and growth of the system.
        In contrast, higher multipliers can introduce volatility and uncertainty. They can create a competitive advantage for early adopters, potentially leading to an imbalance in the system. This could destabilize the system and undermine its long-term sustainability. The 1x multiplier, on the other hand, ensures a level playing field for all participants, promoting stability and long-term growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention of Corruption and Abuse</h2>
        <p>The use of 1x multipliers is a powerful tool to prevent corruption and abuse in the protocol economic system. By allowing service providers (SPs) to freely choose their multiplier, we are removing the human component from the equation. This eliminates the risk of bias and potential abuse that could arise from the discretion of SPs to choose their multiplier.
        <br>
        Moreover, the technical device of a multiplier should not be confused with abuse. The 1x multiplier is not a tool for abuse, but a mechanism to ensure fairness and prevent corruption. It is a safeguard that prevents any single sector from gaining an undue advantage over others through the use of higher multipliers. By sticking to the 1x multiplier, we are ensuring that all sectors are treated equally and that there is no room for corruption or abuse in the system.
        <br>
        In conclusion, the choice of 1x multipliers is the best choice for the protocol economic system. It ensures long-term sustainability by maintaining a level playing field for all sectors and prevents corruption and abuse by removing the human component from the equation. It is a choice that is rooted in fairness, equality, and the long-term health of the network./p>

        <h2>Sovereignty and Freedom</h2>
        <p>Empowering storage providers (SPs) with the sovereignty and freedom to make independent decisions is a vital characteristic of a robust, decentralized system. When considering multipliers in our protocol economic system, maintaining a 1x multiplier ensures this freedom, while also adhering to the principle of fairness.
        <br>
        The 1x multiplier supports SPs' sovereignty by diminishing external influences. When multipliers are variable, SPs can feel pressured to adapt to higher multipliers purely as a competitive strategy, rather than as a conscious business decision. This could inadvertently lead to a race towards higher multipliers, which could distort the market dynamics and potentially lead to inefficiencies and instability in the system.
        <br>
        On the contrary, a consistent 1x multiplier allows SPs to focus on their own unique business strategies without the external pressures introduced by variable multipliers. They can freely choose their participation level based on their capabilities, resources, and strategic goals, without the fear of being disadvantaged. This facilitates a diverse and competitive environment where SPs can operate on a level playing field, and where success is determined by efficiency and innovation, rather than the ability to leverage a higher multiplier</p>

        <h2>Avoiding the Infinite Loop</h2>
        <p>One of the significant risks associated with variable multipliers is the potential for creating an 'infinite loop' that could lead to instability within the system. This loop occurs when SPs continuously strive for higher multipliers to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Once this cycle starts, it can be difficult to break, leading to continual fluctuations and potential instability in the system.
        <br>
        In contrast, maintaining a 1x multiplier prevents this infinite loop scenario. With a fixed multiplier, there is no incentive for SPs to continuously push for higher multipliers, leading to a more stable, predictable system. The 1x multiplier also ensures that the system is not biased towards sectors that adopt higher multipliers, hence ensuring a fair distribution of block rewards among all participants.
        <br>
        Moreover, the 1x multiplier encourages long-term thinking and sustainability. Instead of creating short-term benefits for certain sectors by favoring them with higher multipliers, a consistent 1x multiplier ensures that all sectors are treated equally. This approach aligns with the long-term goal of creating a stable, equitable, and sustainable protocol economic system</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Right Choice</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the 1x multiplier is the right choice for the protocol. It is a simple, fair, and sustainable choice that prevents corruption and abuse, promotes sovereignty and freedom, and avoids the infinite loop of favoring sectors with multipliers. It is the choice that best serves the interests of all stakeholders, ensuring the long-term success and viability of the protocol.</p>
